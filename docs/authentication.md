# Authentication and social sign-in

investi uses Better Auth 1.7.3 with the existing Drizzle account, user, session and verification tables. Email/password and anonymous demo authentication, session hooks and rate limits remain unchanged. No schema migration is needed.

## Optional server configuration

Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` to enable Google, and/or `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID` and `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET` to enable Facebook. Credentials are validated as optional non-empty strings on the server. Empty values are treated as absent. A missing half of a pair disables that provider entirely; it is never passed partially to Better Auth. Restart the server after changing credentials.

`createSocialAuthConfig` produces Better Auth's `socialProviders` and a boolean availability object from the same credential pairs. Only the booleans cross into the client UI. Never prefix these variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Email/password and demo remain available without either provider; absent providers and their divider are hidden.

## Provider consoles and callbacks

Use separate development and production applications/credentials. Do not use production credentials in automated tests.

| Provider | Local authorized callback |
| --- | --- |
| Google | `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` |
| Facebook | `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/facebook` |

Production callbacks must use the **actual HTTPS production origin** with these same paths. Set `BETTER_AUTH_URL` to that origin (and keep `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` consistent). Custom local ports require matching callback registrations. No production hostname is assumed here.

- **Google Cloud:** configure the OAuth consent screen/audience, create a Web application OAuth client, add the authorized redirect URI and relevant app origin, and add test users while in testing mode. Complete Google's publishing/verification requirements as applicable.
- **Meta Developers:** create/configure an app with Facebook Login, enable web OAuth login, register the exact Valid OAuth Redirect URI, and configure the app domain/site URL. Add app-role testers in development mode. Configure privacy policy/data deletion details and complete the permissions/access and live-mode requirements shown in the console before public launch. If the console requires HTTPS for your development setup, register a development HTTPS origin and use it consistently in `BETTER_AUTH_URL`.

Better Auth's built-in scopes request Google identity/email/profile and Facebook email/public profile. No custom provider profile mapping is used. Facebook may omit email, and the installed adapter does not assume an email is verified. Missing email fails cleanly with Czech guidance to use another method; no placeholder address or weakened identity constraint is introduced.

## Account linking and onboarding

Keep Better Auth's safe defaults: implicit linking requires a matching email, a verified local email, and a verified provider email (there is no trusted-provider override). `allowDifferentEmails` is not enabled. Existing linked accounts continue to use their provider account identity.

**Current limitation:** email/password registration does not verify email and this phase does not introduce email verification or an account-linking settings flow. Signing in socially with an existing unverified local email therefore returns `account_not_linked`; it does not create a second user. The page asks the learner to sign in using their original method. Facebook profiles lacking a verified email claim cannot implicitly link even to a verified local account. Do not disable `requireLocalEmailVerified` or force provider trust to bypass this.

Both social buttons call `authClient.signIn.social` with `callbackURL: "/learn"`. The existing authenticated layout decides whether a new learner needs onboarding; returning learners retain their normal destination. Email registration keeps its existing `/onboarding` redirect. Authentication adds no lesson progress or rewards.

## Demo access

Anonymous demo profiles can use all published lessons, Portfolio Lab (including instrument details, buy/sell and reset), and Backtesting Lab immediately. The server reads the stored anonymous identity when evaluating Portfolio Lab access; no client flag can unlock a regular account. First access records a single `demo_access` entitlement with 5,000 Kč of virtual Practice Capital in the existing unlock ledger. Existing sessions get this access on their next visit without reseeding lesson history. Existing unlock receipts and portfolios keep their original capital; reloads, lesson completion and portfolio resets never repeat the grant. Normal accounts retain the Foundations/420 XP requirements. Planned content remains unpublished.

## Failure and loading behavior

OAuth uses full-page redirects. Both social buttons lock immediately during an attempt, with a pending label and `aria-busy`; API/network failures unlock them. Browser Back restores usable buttons. Per-attempt errors return to the originating auth page. Errors without usable OAuth state fall back to `/sign-in` via `onAPIError.errorURL`.

Only allowlisted Czech messages are rendered. Raw provider messages, `error_description`, tokens and other details are never rendered by the social error component. Missing email, unsafe linking, cancellation, unavailable providers and generic callback failures offer a recoverable path. Provider cancellation that never returns to investi can be recovered with Browser Back.

## Verification

Run `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` and `git diff --check`. `scripts/validate-auth.mjs` exercises a fresh local production runtime using disposable local users and **fake** provider credentials; it stops provider navigation before contacting Google/Meta. It checks actual Better Auth authorization URLs and callback cancellation, not a live provider login. See the script's environment requirements. Real consent/token exchange requires manual testing with development credentials.

Implementation was checked against the installed package source, including `oauth2/link-account.mjs`, `api/routes/callback.mjs` and the Google/Facebook adapters.
