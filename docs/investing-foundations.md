# Investing Foundations

The first published module is `/learn/investing-foundations`. It shares the authored block engine, guided runner, progression actions, and curriculum seed with Returns. Seven lessons are published; the checkpoint is planned and has no authored lesson or actionable route.

## Stable curriculum

| Stable lesson ID | Current focus |
| --- | --- |
| `foundations-why-invest` | Saving versus investing, horizon, inflation, and uncertain outcomes |
| `foundations-stocks` | Ownership, quantity × price, price changes, and value distinctions |
| `foundations-etfs-indexes` | Fund versus index, weighted holdings, and concentration |
| `foundations-bonds-cash` | Cash versus lending, principal/coupon/maturity, and issuer risk |
| `foundations-markets` | Bid/ask/spread, order intent, and execution limits |
| `foundations-risk-reward` | Simple returns, growth factors, and compounding asymmetry |
| `foundations-portfolio` | Cash-inclusive value/weights, diversification, and risk |

IDs and slugs survive title/content changes because progress and receipts refer to those IDs. Persisted cursors are numeric; future step reorderings require an explicit resume-compatibility review.

The learning sequence is prediction/question → explanation → interaction/application → mastery checks → Portfolio Lab bridge → summary. Incorrect answers explain the misconception and allow retry. The server requires a correct evaluated answer before moving beyond a question step. Answers and explorer inputs are ephemeral; cursor and completion persist. Review preserves saved completion and receipts.

Integrity tests protect unique blocks, at most one question per step, question-last ordering, a non-question final step, and exactly one authored lesson for every available manifest entry. Planned entries remain unauthored and server-rejected.

## Financial boundaries

Pure educational utilities live in `features/finance`. Ownership, market capitalization, bid/ask spread, drawdown, portfolio weights, and weighted simple returns have finite-input validation and focused numerical tests. Growth reuses the Returns compounding helper; the Foundations compound-return wrapper delegates to the canonical cumulative calculation.

Educational floating-point ratios are distinct from the Portfolio Lab's scaled-bigint ledger. Display rounding never becomes accounting state. The Portfolio Builder uses conceptual stocks/bonds/cash weights and one-period returns; it does not optimize portfolios or calculate covariance. Cash-flow illustrations are not bond yield or total-return estimates. Diversification reduces some risks without eliminating loss.

The Foundations curriculum requires all seven completions and 420 internal XP for a normal user's Portfolio Lab unlock; personalization does not bypass it. See [current reward semantics](product-reset.md) and [portfolio accounting](portfolio-lab.md).

## Validation and future checkpoint

Use `npm run test:foundations-browser` against a fresh local app/database with deterministic providers. The suite completes the beginner journey, retries incorrect answers, verifies persisted cursor/review and unlock invariance, exercises keyboard/focus behavior, six widths (320–1440px), and enlarged text. Domain/registry/transition tests run in `npm test`; financial persistence/concurrency checks have separate package scripts.

The planned checkpoint should retrieve existing concepts using mixed ownership/lending, index/ETF, bid/ask, concentration, weights, horizon, and risk tasks. It should reuse the runner and idempotent completion action, add no score-backed credential or separate assessment state, and introduce no portfolio optimization. It remains future work.
