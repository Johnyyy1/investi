# Returns and compounding

Five Returns lessons are published at `/learn/returns`, following Investing Foundations. They use the shared authored lesson registry, guided blocks, question evaluation, persisted cursor, and completion transaction. No provider-specific lesson engine exists.

| Order | Stable ID / slug | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `returns-what-is-a-return` / `what-is-a-return` | Amount versus proportional price change; the starting-price denominator |
| 2 | `returns-simple-returns` / `simple-returns` | Adjacent decimal returns, moving denominator, N−1 observations, dates/gaps |
| 3 | `returns-compounding` / `compounding-and-cumulative-returns` | Growth factors, cumulative return, ending value, and loss recovery |
| 4 | `returns-comparing` / `comparing-investments` | Price versus total return and a common comparison basis |
| 5 | `returns-log-returns` / `log-returns` | Positive-price log return, time additivity, conversion, small-return approximation |
| Planned | `returns-checkpoint` / `returns-checkpoint` | Integrated transfer exercise; no authored content or publication |

Published IDs, slugs, and numeric step positions are persistence contracts. The learner summary prioritizes active learning; recommendations use published prerequisites. Planned routes/actions remain unavailable. A streamed Next.js unavailable page may have HTTP 200: validate the unavailable UI, `noindex`, and absence of progress writes rather than assuming an HTTP status alone.

## Canonical calculations

`features/finance/returns.ts` owns simple return, absolute change, adjacent numeric returns, cumulative return, compounding traces/value, recovery, log return, and its inverse. Ratios remain unrounded decimal values. Educational `simpleReturn(100, 0)` is −1; the next denominator cannot be zero. Log return requires both prices finite and positive, handles extreme ratios without division overflow/underflow, and is converted back using `Math.expm1` for small-value accuracy. Explicit input/range errors replace non-finite outputs. These functions are not ledger arithmetic.

`features/finance/historical-price-returns.ts` transforms normalized ordered daily split-adjusted closes into adjacent observed returns without IO, formatting, resampling, filling, or annualization. It preserves instrument, currency, adjustment, requested/actual range, completeness, and provenance. Successful N-price input yields N−1 returns. Insufficient data creates no synthetic zero; invalid dates, order, duplicates, non-positive closes, unsupported basis, and non-finite results produce structured invalid states. The current transformation has no historical session-calendar evidence: adjacent calendar days are marked `none`, multi-day spans are `unknown`. It neither claims a missing trading session nor marks weekends/holidays as scheduled. A multi-day interval is never presented as a one-day return.

The existing price-series explorer shows real endpoint dates, paired observations, an undefined first return, the moving denominator, and explicit educational data. Compounding/recovery explorers share the canonical helpers. `compoundPeriods` is an explanatory trace, not a competing return definition; Foundations `compoundReturn` delegates to cumulative return.

## Return basis and Instrument Detail

A comparison requires matching dates, currency, adjustment, distribution/reinvestment, fees, and tax assumptions. The simplified `(end − start + cash distribution) / start` example is a stated cash-inclusive illustration. It is not a general reinvested total-return series. Split adjustment does not include dividends.

Instrument Detail uses available split-adjusted closes in the quote currency for selected-period **price return**. Its `returnPercent` presentation boundary is in percentage units, distinct from decimal helper output and personal CZK portfolio performance. One close supports a price, not a return. Missing history remains unavailable; partial history preserves actual endpoints. Line/candle views share the same endpoint basis; OHLC extremes are not maximum drawdown. Zoom changes the view while selected-range metrics keep their range inputs.

Log returns add through time for one return series; they do not substitute for portfolio-weighted simple returns. Simple returns remain the normal performance wording. Rearranging an identical set of returns changes the path but not its final product in the absence of cash flows.

## Active backlog

The checkpoint remains planned. A future exercise should use a new fixed series with flat and losing intervals, test signed adjacent returns/N−1 and decimal↔percentage conversion, derive cumulative value/recovery, choose a common price/total-return basis, and interpret supplied log values. It can introduce intuitive center/extremes/time order without calculating variance, volatility, or correlation. Reuse existing question types and completion semantics; do not publish future Risk content implicitly.

Read-only market-history lesson integration needs a frozen dataset/basis/provenance so answers stay reproducible. Risk needs return dispersion/frequency conventions; correlation needs explicit interval alignment; portfolio/backtesting work needs consistent return and cash-flow semantics. Live-provider lesson calls, stochastic calculus, total-return data generation, portfolio optimization, and personal transaction-history backtesting remain separate work.

## Validation

`npm test` includes helper edge cases, historical observations, authored content/flow integrity, registry, recommendations, and transition tests. `test:log-returns-persistence` covers correct-answer gates, premature completion, concurrent one-time policy-v2 reward, legacy receipts, L4 preservation, replay, and planned-route rejection.

With deterministic providers and a fresh local app/database, run `test:log-returns-browser` and `BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome node scripts/validate-returns-flow.mjs`. These exercise current lessons, formulas/explorers, retries, resume, Previous, completion/review, sign-in/out, keyboard/focus, reduced motion, six widths, and enlarged text. Screenshots go to `/tmp`; they are not repository fixtures.
